# DU-Event-Listeners

[Deployed Application](https://du-event-listeners.herokuapp.com/)

Description: As our coding bootcamp comes to a close, we wanted to create a way for all us students to keep in touch and continue to collaborate and share ideas in an easy, organized, and effecient way. Whether thats resources, like helpful links, events, like a coding meetup, forum posts for general comments or shoutouts, or even live chat with fellow classmates. This will help all of us continue to develop as professional coders, pursue employement oppurtunities, and further our knowledge

Installation: to use visit the heroku link listed at the bottom or run NPM i in your terminal and then NPM Run Develop to kick off the application locally.

Usage: First, log in or create a user. This will create a user account and allow you access to the various pages. You can then navigate to one of the pages using the navigation tiles. First, Events - allows you to view all events happening organized by date. A user can also add an event with the form on the right side of the page. Next, you have the resources page, which allows users to view various resources and filter based on frontend, backend, or others. A User can also post new resources using the form to the right. Next we move to Forum, which allows the user to filter various Forum posts, modeled after our Class Slack chanels. Users can also add new forum posts for a specific pre-determined topic. Lastly, we have live chat, which allows a user to live chat with another user directly in the application! Simply type a message an hit enter / send. Live chat replies will show directly in the chat window. Other usage features include links to github and linked in in the footer.

Technology: This application is built fully in React as a single page application utilizing express.js. Backend is built completely with Graphql, mongoose, and appollo server. A number of styling and animation React dependencies were used, such as React-Spinners, React-Icons, React-Hook-Forms to name a few. Another key technology used was Socket.io for the live chat.
